            Many differential equations cannot be solved by obtaining an explicit formula for
            the solution. However, we can often find numerical approximations to solutions, one of which 
            is [Eulerâ€™s method](https://brilliant.org/wiki/differential-equations-eulers-method-small-step/), 
            which is also the one used here. Be approximations accurate enough, a pretty reasonable **solution curve** 
            can be plotted by joining the estimated points.

            This is exactly what this program does, and probably what most other tools online do for plotting a solution curve. 
            If you are looking for one that can output a solution formula, if any, you may want to check this tool from 
            [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/differential-equations).

            When it comes to constructing a **slope field**, we can just place a grid of points on the space. Then, draw a vector for
            each point in the direction, governed by x's direction and y's direction, which can be derived from the equation.

            I am sad to let you know that this program cannot work for all sorts of first-order differential equations as of right now.
            For example,
            - variables in the equation must be only `x` and `y`
            - the equation cannot contain a constant in an English letter
            - the program allows the equation to be comprised of only a set of common functions like `sin`, `e`, `ln`
            - other corner cases that I haven't discovered
            
            I do have plans to upgrade this program after this spring semester \:D so that a wider range of equations becomes
            acceptable. Hence, I'm welcoming your inputs if you find any corner cases which crash this little naive program. Have fun playing!
